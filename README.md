# Prework Study Guide, November 2023

## An application outlining 4 key elements of front-end web development

This page was created so that I could easily access the notes I made during the bootcamp prework on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I built this project so I could start building my skills in coding, and so that I have notes that I can reference in the future. I've read a lot of information over the last 2 weeks and so by creating this application, I have had somewhere to note it all down so that I don't have to remember it all in my head. 

I have learnt a LOT by doing this pre-work. I had heard of HTML and CSS before starting, but I had never heard of Git and I barely knew what JavaScript was. I've learnt how to write some very basic code, and how to start adding some functionality to my page by using JavaScript.
