        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML creates the structure of a website.</li>
          <li>Head elements contain metadata that is not visible to the user, but helps render the webpage correctly.</li>
          <li>There are 'title' 'style' 'base' 'link' 'script' and 'meta' tags that can be used inside the head element.</li>
          <li>Body elements contain content that is shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The meta viewport tag should be included in the head of all websites to ensure it renders correctly on all devices.</li>
          <li>There are 'parent' and 'child' elements.</li>
          <li>Many HTML elements are semantic (they are named what they represent) and it's good practice to use these.</li>
          <li>H1 to H6 should be used in order on a page, h1 should only be used once.</li>
        </ul>

  <section class="card" id="css section">
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Three ways to do CSS: inline, internal style sheet, external style sheet.</li>
      <li>The external style sheet needs to be linked to your HTML by using the 'link' tag in the 'head'.</li>
      <li>Margin property is the space inside an element.</li>
      <li>Padding property is the space outside an element.</li>
      <li>Think of each element as a box, with content, padding, margin.</li>
      <li>Selectors denote which elements you want the CSS rules to apply to.</li>
      <li>The selector * (asterix) applies the rule to ALL visible elements on a document.</li>
      <li>You can apply multiple selectors to a single line of code by separating them with a comma, so that you can apply the same formatting to multiple elements (eg. header, footer) without repeating code. </li>
      <li>Eg: img is a selector, block is a value (which assigns each image to start on a new line).</li>
      <li>No need to use triangular brackets.</li>
      <li>Class attributes: allows you to apply CSS to certain elements only.
      <li>The full stop before a class attribute (eg .class) denotes that this is the class selector, so any element assigned to 'card' will have this formatting.
      <li>In the HTML, this will look like section class="card".</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="git section">
    <h2>Git</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All git commands must start with git.</li>
      <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
      <li>git checkout -b feature/new-branch-name: creates new branch.</li>
      <li>1. git add -A: stage all changes in a file (ready to be committed).</li>
      <li>2. git commit -m "explain-changes-being-committed": commit your code with a message to explain what changes you are committing.</li>
      <li>3. git pull origin main: pull the latest version of the branch on to your local machine (check you're up to date basically).</li>
      <li>4. git push origin feature/featurename: pushes changes up to GitHub ready for review and merging with main branch.</li>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Variables are containers that store values.</li>
      <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
      <li>Semicolons indicate where a statement ends.</li>
      <li>There are different data types, eg. a string (text), number, boolean (true/false), array, object (can be anything!).</li>
      <li>Comments can be added to JS with /*comment*/ - this will 'hide' the code.</li>
      <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result, such as adding, assigning, strict equality.</li>
      <li>To declare a variable, we use 'var' and then give the variable a name.</li>
      <li>The console.log() method instructs content inside the brackets to be logged to the console (which you can access by right clicking and hitting inspect in google </li>
      <lil>Control flow is the order in which computer executes code or text comment.</lil>
      <li>IF statements check if a condition is truthy or falsy. The code will then only be executed if the condition is truthy.</li>
      <li>A value is falsy if it is: 0, -0, 0n, "", null, undefined, NaN, or false.</li>
      <li>Use 'else if' to go through more conditions.</li>
      <li>ARRAYS: allows you to assign multiple values to a variable, using []. These are indexed, starting from 0, so that you can pull out a single value from an array.</li>
      <li>FOR LOOPS: allows you to execute code multiple times. You must determine the starting point for the loop, give the condition (eg. if the number is less than the length of the array, continue), and then put in code to allow the array to iterate over each item.</li>
      <li>FUNCTIONS: instruct the computer to perform a task. You must define the function, and then call it. Functions are not automatically executed like for/if statements.</li>
      <li>Functions are defined by using the keyword 'function', and the name of the function must always be followed by parentheses ().</li>
